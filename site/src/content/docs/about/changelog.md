## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-12

Initial public release of StackVitals — a self-hosted, single-owner operations dashboard that
surfaces uptime, deploy health, provider status, month-to-date cloud cost, and AI/CI usage for a
handful of personal web projects, without copying raw app data out of the source projects.

### Added

- Vite + React + TypeScript frontend that reads pre-aggregated rows from Supabase and renders
  deploy health, uptime, provider status, domain health, usage roll-ups, collector diagnostics,
  and month-to-date vs. last-month cost across Detail / Collectors / Usage / Costs tabs.
- Node collector pipeline built on a single `ProviderAdapter` contract, run on a schedule from
  GitHub Actions, writing append-only snapshots back to Supabase.
- Collector adapters: HTTP health, AWS Amplify deploy status, AWS Cost Explorer, Supabase project
  health, watched-app Supabase aggregates, Resend domain verification, OpenAI usage, GitHub
  Actions usage, and Cloudflare domains.
- Config-driven, opt-in setup: adapters activate only when credentials are present, and
  `projects.config.json` resolves `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders so no secrets are committed.
- Single-owner access model with email allowlist and Supabase RLS.
- Demo mode with fictional data and screenshot capture script.
- CI workflow and scheduled collector workflow with GitHub Actions job summaries.
- Self-hosting guide and contributing guide.
